# Getting Started with Create React App

This was a fun time saving app for my DnD group.
It's a React app that uses Firebase as our backend to store a database and images.

This project was originally based on this Udemy tutorial
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/

However, I've heavily refactored it, for reusability, easier maintainance and added new features.
For example, the original tutorial has a single 970 line index.css file.

### What I've changed.

- I restuctured each react component into a MVC folder structure with the JSX separate from the business logic.
- I commented all of the business logic as though I was explaining it to a colleague
- Refactored styling into multiple SASS modules per each JSX file.
- Complete visual redesign
- Switched to react context for main states.
